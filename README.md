[Full Repport](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/Unity-Pathfinders-Visualizer/blob/9f772b44865a08bb183b02f37a3931a7dd0994ec/Github.pdf).

**Unity Pathfinders Visualized** is a Unity project demonstrating key pathfinding algorithms. The project implements:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Efficient for the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Bidirectional Breadth-First Search:** Enhances BFS by searching from both start and end points.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Useful in maze generation, exploring deeply before backtracking.
- **Swarm Algorithm:** Combines BFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm, effective in complex scenarios.

## Features
- **Algorithm Simulations:** Visualize BFS, Bidirectional BFS, DFS, and Swarm in action.
- **Dynamic Grids:** Test algorithms on various grid layouts and obstacles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Enable Gizmos in Unity for enhanced visualization.
4. Run the scene to observe pathfinding simulations.

*Note: Intended for Unity editor use only ,Gizmos is only used for editor.*

## Usage
