# Unity Pathfinders Visualizer
![BFS Example](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/Unity-Pathfinders-Visualized/blob/main/ScreenShot/BFS%20(7).png)
## Description
**Unity Pathfinders Visualized** is a Unity project demonstrating key pathfinding algorithms. The project implements:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Efficient for the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Bidirectional Breadth-First Search:** Enhances BFS by searching from both start and end points.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Useful in maze generation, exploring deeply before backtracking.
- **Swarm Algorithm:** Combines BFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm, effective in complex scenarios.

## Features
- **Algorithm Simulations:** Visualize BFS, Bidirectional BFS, DFS, and Swarm in action.
- **Dynamic Grids:** Test algorithms on various grid layouts and obstacles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Run the scene to observe pathfinding simulations.
4. Enable Gizmos in Unity for enhanced visualization.

*Note: Intended for Unity editor use only.*

## Usage
- Customize experiments with different parameters.
- Conduct comparative studies between algorithms.
